Liri app creation

This app will allow you to put in two arguments a command for the first and a search term for the second the commands and search terms are as follows:

'my-tweets' (nothing) - will print the last 20 tweets

'spotify-this-song' 'song' - will search the song

'movie-this' 'movie' - will search the movie

'do-what-it-says' (nothing) - will search whatever command w/ or w/o a search term that's entered in the random.text file (e.g. spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way")

If you do not enter any search command listed above, you will be requested to do so upon a blank submission. If you do not enter the song or movie command but no search term, a default song (The Sign) or default movie (Mr.Nobody) search results will be printed.
